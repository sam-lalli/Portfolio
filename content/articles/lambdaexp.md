I, like most 20 year olds had no idea what I wanted to do. No idea what to study, what career to go into, so I did what most do and enrolled in a ![local university](https://www.uvu.edu/). Started taking a whole bunch of different classes to see what perked my interest.
I found I enjoyed my computer science classes, it was the only homework I actually wanted to do. Thought that had to be a good sign and declared my major as Computer Science. Then Covid happened and everything changed, except that my school projects were still due on the same days. I did not want to fail my classes but there was no real motivation to do anything and a lot of learning became the exploration of google. Luckily that is where I found ![Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/homepage)

It was a non-conventional method and there were a lot of mixed reviews online about the legitimacy of Lambda really preparing you for the real work force. A 9 month program that teaches you the skills to start a career without 4 years and mounds of student debt? I thought if I would really work. I also thought what do I really have to lose, so I enrolled, I took the leap of faith and I could not be more grateful I did.

Lambda is not like any other school. Lambda is a full-time job. 9am-6pm 5 days a week, plus the extra time you spend if you are behind or finishing your daily projects. Not being recognized most places as a post-secondary education it gives Lambda the ability to change policy or curriculum in real time which, can be crazy at times but it taught me to adapt and make the most out of everything Lambda had to offer. It was a grind to say the least but the support they give you is unmatched by anything I had ever seen, Even after you graduate. They provide you with not only the competancy but the confidence to go out and get that job. Lambda School really is like a bucket, you only get out what you put in and the posibilites are endless.
