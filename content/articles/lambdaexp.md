Like a lot of others my age, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I wasn’t sure what to study or what career to go into, so I enrolled in classes at a local university. After attending a variety of classes to see what piqued my interest, I found I enjoyed my computer science classes the most. It was the only homework I actually wanted to do. Because of this, I declared my major as Computer Science. After the pandemic began, and everything changed, I decided to look into another educational path. That’s when I found Lambda School.

It was a non-conventional method, and there were a lot of mixed reviews online about the legitimacy of Lambda really preparing you for the real work force. A nine-month program that teaches you the skills to start a career without four years and mounds of student debt? I wondered if the program would really work. I took a leap of faith and enrolled, and I could not be more grateful I did.

Lambda isn’t like any other school. It’s a full-time job: 9 am-6 pm, five days a week, plus the extra time you spend if you are behind or finishing your daily projects. Because Lambda isn’t often recognized as a post-secondary education, it gives the program the ability to change policy or curriculum in real time. This taught me to adapt and make the most out of everything I learned while I was enrolled. It was a grind, but the support they give you is unmatched. Especially after you graduate. They provide you with not only the competency but the confidence to go out and get that job. Lambda School is like a bucket… you get out what you put in, and the possibilities are endless.
